# Pinged

**Pinged** is a swipe-based connection app designed to make meeting new people easier and more natural than cold messaging.  
Instead of reaching out through awkward DMs, users can swipe through profiles and connect when there’s mutual interest — similar to how dating apps streamline matching, but for general social or professional networking.

### 💡 What It Does
- Lets users **create profiles** and **discover others nearby or within their network**
- Uses a **swipe interface** to express interest and match with people
- Opens a **chat** only when both users swipe right — encouraging more meaningful connections
- Aims to make connecting **faster, friendlier, and less intimidating** than traditional outreach

### 🎯 Goal
To remove the friction of starting conversations by replacing cold messages with warm, mutual connections.
